Okay, I'm looking at this user's query. They provided an extract from a document discussing ethics and asked for a clear, simple summary. Let me break it down.

First, the document starts with an overview of ethics, defining it as actions that guide one's life and contribute to society or its dismantling. It then talks about normative and metaethics branches under normative ethics, each attributed to key philosophers. There are two sections: a broad ethical questions section and a detailed breakdown.

The user wants a summary in a clear, simple way. So I need to condense all this information without losing the essential points. I should identify the main elements: what ethics is about, branches, key philosophers, and how these fit into normative vs metaethics.

I should structure it by first stating that ethics involves actions guiding one's life and society, then mention the two major branches of normative ethics with applied and metaethics, each branch having different perspectives on value. Including notable philosophers for each would add depth but in a summary, I can note their names without going into detail.

I should make sure it's concise, maybe three paragraphs: one about what ethics is, another about the two branches of normative ethics, and a third about metaethics with the key philosophers. That way, it's easy to read and understand.

Also, since the original document mentions "Ethics can be defined...," I can just restate that briefly in the summary without expanding too much.

I think I've covered all the main points: definition, branches, key figures, so this should meet the user's request effectively.

Sure! Here’s a clear, simple summary of the extract:

**Ethics Overview:**  
Ethics is about making good decisions and acting in ways that align with “good” values. It helps us understand what’s right or wrong in our lives and society.

**Branches of Ethics:**
1. **Normative Ethics (what to do):** This branch asks big questions like, "Should we eat animals?" or "Euthanasia?" and uses philosophers like Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill.
2. **Metaethics (what is ethics?):** This branch explores deeper questions about what makes something ethical, such as whether it exists. It uses philosophers like G.E. Moore, J.L. Mackie, and A.J. Ayer.

I hope this summary helps! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
