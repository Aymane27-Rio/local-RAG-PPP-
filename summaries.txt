Okay, so I need to create a summary based on the provided document. Let me read through it carefully first.

The document starts with an introduction titled "Ethics". It defines ethics as the set of actions and behaviors individuals engage in within society or outside of it that guide their lives and contribute to the establishment or demolition of societal principles. The philosophical study of ethics is about understanding good and evil through these actions and values.

Then, under "Branches", it explains that ethics can generally be divided into two main branches: normative ethics and metaethics. Normative ethics focuses on guiding actions by answering questions like what to do, how, why. Metaethics addresses more abstract questions about the nature of ethics itself without being concerned with the morality of specific actions.

Further, it breaks down normative ethics into applied ethics and a subcategory called "Normative Ethics". Applied ethics deals with applying ethical principles in daily lifeâ€”like political or environmental ethics. The key question here is determining the moral framework one uses to make ethical judgments. Metaethics includes philosophical questions about what constitutes rightness or wrongness, such as G.E. Moore's analysis.

So, the document seems to cover both normative and metaethical perspectives of ethics, with examples from different branches like applied and metaethics within each branch. It also introduces key philosophers for each area.

Now, I need to summarize this clearly and simply. The user probably wants a concise overview that captures the main points without getting too detailed. Let me try to capture all necessary elements.

I should mention the definition of ethics as actions guiding lives, the philosophical study aspect, branches into normative and metaethics, applied vs. normative ethics, and examples with key philosophers like Kant, Mill, Moore, Mackie, Ayer, and more in metaethics within each branch. Also, include how ethical judgment is tied to moral frameworks.

I need to make sure the summary is straightforward and easy to understand, maybe using bold headings for branches and subcategories.

**Summary of Ethical Studies**

Ethics can be defined as the set of actions individuals engage in (within or outside society) that guide their lives and contribute to societal principles. The field examines ethics from a philosophical standpoint, focusing on two main branches: normative ethics and metaethics.

**Normative Ethics**  
- **Applied Ethics**: Deals with applying ethical principles in daily life, such as political or environmental ethics. Key examples include the use of moral frameworks like Kant's duties principle or Mill's utilitarianism.
- **Subcategory: Normative Ethics**  
  - Focuses on determining the rightness or wrongness of actions through broader ethical questions. Key figures here are Aristotle and G.E. Moore.

**Metaethics**  
- Analyzes abstract ethical questions about ethics itself, without moral application. Key thinkers include J.L. Mackie and A.J. Ayer. Metaethics within each branch explores what constitutes rightness or wrongness, considering concepts like justice.

Key philosophers in metaethics: Moore, Mackie, Ayer; applied ethics: Kant, Mill; metaethics: G.E. Moore.

This summary captures the essence of ethical studies, highlighting key branches and their subcategories, along with influential thinkers.

Okay, I need to summarize this extrait from a document. Let me read through it first.

It's about applied ethics with two main parts: Moral Theories and Metaethics. Under Moral Theories, there are moral theories like Utilitarianism, Deontological Ethics, Virtue Ethics, Contractarianism, and another section on their strengths and weaknesses.

Then under Metaethics, it talks about Epistemology, Semantics, and Metaphysics. Epistemology is about how we know ethics, Semantics deals with language and meaning in ethics, and Metaphysics explores the nature of ethics itself.

So I should create a clear summary that includes both parts. Maybe structure it into two sections: one for each part, with definitions and key points. Make sure to highlight the main theories under each section and their subcategories.

I need to keep it simple and concise, so avoid jargon where possible. Also, make sure to mention the strengths of each theory under Moral Theories.

**Applied Ethics Summary**

Applied ethics explores how ethical principles are used in real-world situations. Under **Moral Theories**, there are several key perspectives:

1. **Utilitarianism/Consequentialism**: Focuses on actions' outcomes or consequences for their morality.
2. **Deontological Ethics**: Evaluates the inherent rightness or wrongness of an action, independent of its results.
3. **Virtue Ethics**: Emphasizes character traits and their role in ethics, rooted in personal qualities like courage.
4. **Contractarianism**: Argues ethical principles arise from social contracts intended to regulate interactions.

**Metaethics**, which examines the fundamental questions about ethics:

1. **Moral Epistemology**: Examines how we acquire ethical knowledge and justify our beliefs.
2. **Moral Semantics**: Investigates the meaning of ethical language in sociocultural contexts.
3. **Moral Metaphysics**: Questions whether ethical principles exist independently of experience.

This summary captures both parts, providing an overview of applied ethics theories and their branches.
